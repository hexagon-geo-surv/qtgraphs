 * \class Q3DSurface
 * \inmodule QtGraphs
 * \brief The Q3DSurface class provides methods for rendering 3D surface plots.
 *
 * This class enables developers to render 3D surface plots and to view them by rotating the scene
 * freely. The visual properties of the surface such as draw mode and shading can be controlled
 * via QSurface3DSeries.
 *
 * The Q3DSurface supports selection by showing a highlighted ball on the data point where the user has clicked
 * with left mouse button (when default input handler is in use) or selected via QSurface3DSeries.
 * The selection pointer is accompanied with a label which in default case shows the value of the
 * data point and the coordinates of the point.
 *
 * The value range and the label format shown on the axis can be controlled through QValue3DAxis.
 *
 * To rotate the graph, hold down the right mouse button and move the mouse. Zooming is done using mouse
 * wheel. Both assume the default input handler is in use.
 *
 * If no axes are set explicitly to Q3DSurface, temporary default axes with no labels are created.
 * These default axes can be modified via axis accessors, but as soon any axis is set explicitly
 * for the orientation, the default axis for that orientation is destroyed.
 *
 * \section1 How to construct a minimal Q3DSurface graph
 *
 * First, construct Q3DSurface. Since we are running the graph as top level window
 * in this example, we need to clear the \c Qt::FramelessWindowHint flag, which gets set by
 * default:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 0
 *
 * Now Q3DSurface is ready to receive data to be rendered. Create data elements to receive values:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 1
 *
 * First feed the data to the row elements and then add their pointers to the data element:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 2
 *
 * Create a new series and set data to it:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 3
 *
 * Finally you will need to set it visible:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 4
 *
 * The complete code needed to create and display this graph is:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 5
 *
 * And this is what those few lines of code produce:
 *
 * \image q3dsurface-minimal.png
 *
 * The scene can be rotated, zoomed into, and a surface point can be selected to view its position,
 * but no other interaction is included in this minimal code example.
 * You can learn more by familiarizing yourself with the examples provided,
 * like the \l{Surface Example}.

/*!
 * \property Q3DSurface::flipHorizontalGrid
 *
 * \brief Whether the horizontal axis grid is displayed on top of the graph
 * rather than on the bottom.
 *
 * In some use cases the horizontal axis grid is mostly covered by the surface, so it can be more
 * useful to display the horizontal axis grid on top of the graph rather than on the bottom.
 * A typical use case for this is showing 2D spectrograms using orthoGraphic projection with
 * a top-down viewpoint.
 *
 * If \c{false}, the horizontal axis grid and labels are drawn on the horizontal background
 * of the graph.
 * If \c{true}, the horizontal axis grid and labels are drawn on the opposite side of the graph
 * from the horizontal background.
 * Defaults to \c{false}.
 */

/*!
 * Adds \a axis to the graph. The axes added via addAxis are not yet taken to use,
 * addAxis is simply used to give the ownership of the \a axis to the graph.
 * The \a axis must not be null or added to another graph.

 * \sa releaseAxis(), setAxisX(), setAxisY(), setAxisZ()
 */

/*!
 * Releases the ownership of the \a axis back to the caller, if it is added to this graph.
 * If the released \a axis is in use, a new default axis will be created and set active.
 *
 * If the default axis is released and added back later, it behaves as any other axis would.
